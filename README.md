# Bank
Repository to hold code related to a faux bank I am creating
This bank is to be based off of an animated show. (Still in progress as I save different milestones)
Currently in this version is the simple functions such as:
- logging in the user
- logging out the user
- adding money via deposit
- removing money via withdrawal per customer and more

Future features include:
- Allowing money transfer between customers (Zelle)
- Creating multiple account types for one user.
- Loan Services
- Chat box

In order to run client:
- Need to run "npm run dev" in the terminal

In order to run server:
- Need to run "npm run devStart" in the terminal

  Need to listen on on http://localhost:5173/home

  You may also need to download the node modules folder within the terminal
