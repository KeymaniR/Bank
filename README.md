# Bank
Repository to hold code related to a faux bank I am creating
This bank is to be based off of an animated show. (Still in progress as I save different milestones)
Currently in this version is the simple functions such as:
- logging in the user
- logging out the user
- adding money via deposit
- removing money via withdrawal per customer and more

Future features include:
- Allowing money transfer between customers (Zelle)
- Creating multiple account types for one user.
- Loan Services
- Chat box
